description: "Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and publish-subscribe topics. Service Bus is used to decouple applications and services from each other, providing load-balancing work across competing works, safely routing and transferring data and control across service and application boundaries, and coordinating transactional work that requires a high-degree of reliability."
